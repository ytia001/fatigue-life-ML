# fatigue-life-ML
Machine learning based prediction of PAAm hydrogel fatigue life under the effect of dehydration.

Project involves 3 stages:
1. Generation of Raw data: Raw data (total:90) was generated from fatigue experiment of PAAm hydrogel under dehydration
2. Data processing: Raw data was processed using MATLAB. Two MATLAB scripts were used, data analysis and feature extraction will be performed on raw data
3. Machine learning prediction: The processed data will undergo data cleaning and data augmentation before fitting into the 5 different machine learning models. The accuracy of the models will be tested with the coefficent of value (R2)
